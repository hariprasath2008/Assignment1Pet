# Virtual Pet Simulator

## Overview
This is a simple C# application that allows users to take care of a virtual pet, choosing among a cat, dog, or rabbit. The user can perform various actions to maintain their pet's wellbeing, ensuring it remains happy and healthy.

## Detailed Project Features

### 1. Pet Creation
- Users can choose a pet type (cat, dog, rabbit) and name their pet.
- A welcome message will be displayed, including the pet's type and name.

### 2. Pet Care Actions
- **Feeding**: Decreases hunger and slightly increases health.
- **Playing**: Increases happiness and slightly increases hunger.
- **Resting**: Improves health and slightly decreases happiness.
- Each action modifies the pet's stats accordingly and displays a message describing the action's effect.

### 3. Pet Status Monitoring
- The petâ€™s stats are tracked and displayed, including hunger, happiness, and health, each on a scale of 1 to 10.
- A status check is implemented to warn the user if any stat is critically low or high.

### 4. Time-Based Changes
- The application simulates the passage of time, with each action representing the passing of an hour.
- Hunger increases over time, and happiness decreases slightly, prompting regular interaction from the user.

### 5. Enhanced Interaction Logic
- If the pet is neglected, there are consequences, such as health deterioration if the pet is too hungry or unhappy.
- Special messages or events are included based on the pet's status (e.g., the pet refusing to play if it is too hungry).
